# DwD_final_project

This is the final project from the NYU dealing with data course by Prof. Kristen Sosulski.

I extract the insights from the Netflix/ HBO/ Amazon/ Disney TV Shows and Movies Datasets.
Clean the data, use SQL to join the data and extract insights.

Five key findings are as follows:
Q1: What is the count of movies and TV shows across different service providers (different datasets)?
Q2: What are the best comedy movies in each dataset? (Find the top five IMDB Rating comedy movies in each dataset)
Q3: What is the trend of release number for all the productions in each dataset from 1980 to 2022?
Q4: What is the mean IMDB score for comedy across different provider (in various datasets)?
Q5: What is the Total Release number per Country by Netflix?
